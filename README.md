# Slark

Slark is a tool for viewing static and animated images.

You can load multiple images into Slark and then drag them around the canvas.

Use PGUP / PGDN to control their Z-ordering.

Ctrl+S / Ctrl+O to save / open a project file which remembers all the opened images and their location and z-order.

Supported image formats are GIF, WebP, JPEG, and PNG.

## Project status

Slark is currently in the prototyping stage. Nothing is guaranteed to work!
